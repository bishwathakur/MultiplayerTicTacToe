# MultiplayerTicTacToe

MultiplayerTicTacToe is an Android application that implements a real-time multiplayer version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using socket communication.

## Backend Logic

The game uses a client-server architecture with WebSocket communication for real-time gameplay. Here's an overview of the backend logic:

1. **Server Setup**: A WebSocket server is implemented using a library like `socket.io` or `Ktor WebSockets`.

2. **Room Management**: 
   - The server maintains a list of active game rooms.
   - Players can create new rooms or join existing ones.
   - Each room has a unique identifier.

3. **Game State**: 
   - The server maintains the game state for each room, including:
     - Current board state
     - Current player's turn
     - Game status (in progress, won, draw)

4. **Move Validation**:
   - The server validates each move to ensure it's legal.
   - Checks include: correct player's turn, valid position, non-occupied cell.

5. **Win Condition Check**:
   - After each move, the server checks for a win condition or draw.

6. **Real-time Updates**:
   - The server broadcasts updates to all players in the room after each valid move.

## Socket Communication

The application uses WebSockets for bidirectional, real-time communication:

1. **Connection**: 
   - Players connect to the server upon entering the game.
   - The server assigns a unique ID to each connection.

2. **Room Join/Create**:
   - Players send a message to join or create a room.
   - The server responds with room details and opponent information.

3. **Game Events**:
   - `makeMove`: Client sends move information.
   - `gameUpdate`: Server broadcasts updated game state.
   - `gameOver`: Server notifies clients of game end and result.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - The server sends error messages for invalid moves or other issues.

## Data Structures

1. **Game Board**: Represented as a 3x3 array or list.
2. **Player**: Contains player ID, name, and symbol (X or O).
3. **Room**: Includes room ID, players, current game state, and move history.

## Security Considerations

- Input validation on both client and server sides.
- Rate limiting to prevent spam or DOS attacks.
- Authentication for players (if implementing user accounts).

## Scalability

- The server is designed to handle multiple game rooms concurrently.
- Consider implementing a load balancer for high traffic scenarios.

## Future Improvements

- Implement matchmaking system.
- Add spectator mode for ongoing games.
- Introduce player rankings and leaderboards.
